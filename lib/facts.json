    "A new study shows that the insects change their aggressive behavior when they know other crickets are watching, the first time this phenomenon has been observed in any invertebrate. Mammals, birds, and fish are all known to be influenced by others. In recent experiments, male crickets fighting in an arena acted more violently—and upon winning, were more jubilant—when other male or female crickets were in the audience.",
    "Insects called crickets but not of the cricket family Gryllidae include the camel cricket, Jerusalem cricket, mole cricket, and pygmy sand cricket.",
    "Crickets sing an impressive variety of songs, each with its own purpose. A male’s calling song invites receptive females to come closer and get to know him. He then serenades the female with his courthship song, trying to convince her that he is the best among her suitors. If she accepts him as a mate, he may sing a song to announce their partnership. Male crickets also sing rivalry songs to defend their territories from competitors. Each cricket species produces its own signature call, with a unique volume and pitch.",
    "Thanks to the demand created by reptile owners and breeders, cricket-breeding is a multimillion dollar business in the U.S. Large scale cricket breeders may raise as many as 50 million crickets at a time in warehouse-sized facilities.",
    "To hear the mating call of other crickets, a cricket has ears located on its knees, just below the joint of the front legs."
